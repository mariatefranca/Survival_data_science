# AI/ML Model to Predict the Survival Chances of Patients after 1 Year of Treatment.

A hospital in the province of Greenland has been trying to improve its care conditions by looking at historic survival of the patients. They tried looking at their data but could not identify the main factors leading to high survivals.   
The aim of this project was to develop a model to predict the chances of survival of a patient after 1 year of treatment (Survived_1_year).

This notebook was built as a final assignment for the 5 Weeks Data Science Bootcamp of AIplanet.
